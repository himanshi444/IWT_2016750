                A coffee cup is a container, a cup, for serving coffee and coffee-based drinks. 
                There are three major types: conventional cups used with saucers, mugs used without saucers, and disposable cups. Cups and mugs generally have a handle. 
                Disposable paper cups used for take-out sometimes have fold-out handles, but are more often used with an insulating coffee cup sleeve.
                Coffee cups and mugs may be made of glazed ceramic, porcelain, plastic, glass, insulated or uninsulated metal, and other materials. 
                Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or polystyrene foam (often mistakenly called Styrofoam).
