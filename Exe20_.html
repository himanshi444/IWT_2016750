                <p>
                I have always loved spending way too much time on the computer, and <br>
                spent my teens tinkering with Photoshop and building crappy websites.<br>
                But after getting a computer science degree, I realized writing <br>
                compilers was notfor me and decided to switch majors completely and <br>
                learn Mandarin instead.<br>

                Yet as it turns out, my path would lead back to computers: after moving<br>
                to China in 2006, I ended up quitting my language studies and getting a<br>
                job in Beijing as a web designer.<br>
