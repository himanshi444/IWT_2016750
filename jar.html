                A jar is a rigid, cylindrical or slightly conical container.
                It is typically made of glass, ceramic, or plastic.
                It is with a wide mouth or opening that can be closed with a lid, screw cap, lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, heat sealed lidding film, an inner seal, a tamper-evident band, or other suitable means.
