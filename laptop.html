            Laptops are computers designed for portability. 
            They have all the same components and capabilities of traditional desktops, but are smaller and can fold up.
            Laptops are generally less powerful than desktops.
            There are different categories of laptops designed for various uses.
            Many laptops come with options to upgrade specific components to tailor them to the needs of the user.
